## Tests

To run tests, run the following command:
Before you test, make sure you have a .gitignore file in the root of your repository
to prevent tracking 

After you have installed  all the reuired dependencies for your application using the command line. 
In this project, I am using Node.js and inquirer 8.2.4
To test, Run "node + filename". Here I am using "node index.js" and hit enter
This should prompt you to answer a few questions, if you get an error, read the error, fix
and start again 

To run tests, run the following command:

```
node index.js
```
